Master Nodes: These nodes manage the cluster and are responsible for API access, scheduling, and the overall control of the system.

Worker Nodes: These nodes run the containerized applications and services. They handle the actual workloads and are managed by the master nodes.

Infrastructure Nodes: These nodes handle specific services like routers, monitoring, and logging, which support the operation of the cluster.
cluster is called, master node and worker node combiantion 

In OpenShift, a pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.
A pod encapsulates one or more containers (e.g., Docker containers), storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the containers should run.
Containers within a pod share the same network namespace, meaning they can communicate with each other using localhost. 

In essence, master nodes orchestrate and schedule, worker nodes execute and manage pods, and pods run the containerized applications.

oc get all      -to check all resources in the chapter1
oc get pods      - displays the pods
oc get nodes      - displays the all nodes
oc get pod -o wide    - all the nodes, worker and master node and in which node its working                        -

oc get clusteroperators   - manages the cluster, openshift by internal applications which manages the cluster,
imp components for api operator, authentication operator and so onfor the cluster

to check what all pods are consuming by the operator,for example an image registry operator how many pods are currently running inside
our cluster image registry, - oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry

to check which pod is running in which nod, oc get pods -n openshift-image-registry -o wide

to check the logs of the pods, - oc logs node-ca-<podeID> -n openshift-image-registry

TROUBLESHOOTING

oc status   -----to check status 
oc get events ------ to check the events
oc edit <deployment> -psql  -----open deployment yaml file

As the developer user, create a pod called ubi9-user from a UBI9 base container image.
The image is available in the registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/ubi9/ubi container registry. 
Set the restart policy to Never and start an interactive session.Configure the pod to execute the whoami and id commands to determine the UIDs, supplemental groups, and GIDs of the container user in the pod.
Delete the pod afterward.

oc run -it ubi9-user --restart 'Never' \
 --image registry.ocp4.example.com:8443/ubi9/ubi \
 -- /bin/bash -c "whoami && id"

To delete the pod
oc delete pod ubi9-user
